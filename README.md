This week, I build a portfolio page.
A portfolio of work that showcases my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. I added sections about me, portfolio porjects, a case study I did for a client, and contact section. 

This project I applyied the core skills learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. 

The criteria:
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
