                        <h1>Defining the Brand</h1>
                        <p>
                            Through a series of exercises in the strategy session, we were able to extract and refine the
                            key pillars of the brand. This defined the brand's personality: how it should look, sound, and act.

                        <h1>Developing the Strategy</h1>
                        <p>
                            I sat down with Kendall Keeter, the business owner, to craft the brand's strategy and new identity.
                            Over a facilitated session, I unsurfaced the challenges the business faced. In the process, we were able to 
                            prioritized the needs and goals of the business and its customers. This became the foundation for the
                            branding and marketing plans of her website and social media platforms.

                        <h1>Understanding the Users</h1>
                        <p>
                            To understand the needs of her customers, I created unique profiles to represent the range of clients. This
                            painted a clear picture of their demographics, psychographics, needs, and wants.  
                        </p>
                        <h3>Positioning</h3>
                        <p>Understanding what the KKP brand is and who Kendall is a champion for, helped define the positioning statment of the organization:</p>
                        <p><strong>Experience your fairytale; full of dreams, magic, and adventure.</strong></p>

                    <h1>Brand Refresh</h1>
                    <p>
                        I developed an entire identity system to make sure every client's touch-point reflected the brand. 
                        The rebrand included updating the logo, introducing a new color palette, a new typeface, and 
                        collateral pieces. This created a more cohesive experience for both the photoshoot and its digital extensions.

                        I decided to create a hand drawn logo for Kendall to create a personalized feeling. I created a monogram
                        combining the letter K and an infinity sign.

                        I updated the typeface of the brand to be modern and clean, and another to leave a personal touch. 
                        Both typefaces are flexible enough to work wellacross large printed displays down to small digital screens.

                        I wanted the colors to reflect that by being calm and dreamy.

                        several user goals that needed to be addressed and accomplished. I was able to strike a nice balance between bookings
